## [Coding Challenges](/coding-challenges/)

My solutions to coding challenges.
I try to do a coding challenge every day to stay sharp and level up my problem solving skills. I started solving challenges on [codewars](codewars.com), where I've completed [Over 500 challenges](https://www.codewars.com/users/jasoncarr95), but I also will do leetcode or other challenges from different sources.

## [Data Structures & Algorithms](/dsa/)

Notes & examples of Common Data Structures & Algorithms implemented in JavaScript.
